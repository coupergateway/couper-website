            <Typography.Paragraph>
              Security must play a vital part during all stages of application development, especially if the
              app is supposed to access critical business data and resources.
            </Typography.Paragraph>
            <Typography.Paragraph>
              However, implementing security measures is a highly complex matter. Changes in project requirements
              or responsibilities as well as the integration of third-party services make the work of developers
              challenging and thus endanger the security of sensitive data.

            <Typography.Paragraph>
              Couper offers various authentication and authorization mechanisms on a separate layer, facilitating

            <Typography.Paragraph>
              Too many applications are overloaded with features because they are supposed to
              simultaneously address the challenges of various target groups:
              just think of power users and regular users and their different needs when it
              comes to required functionalities or data.
            </Typography.Paragraph>
            <Typography.Paragraph>
              Dedicated micro products can offer outstanding user experiences and enable you to
              meet the needs of your distinct user groups. However, replicating functionality and
              service integration seems to be a daunting task. Because the decoupling of front
              and back end implies big challenges, projects all too often take the route to a
              one-size-fits-no-one middle ground.
            </Typography.Paragraph>
            <Typography.Paragraph>
              With Couper, you can design dedicated front-end APIs that help you launch new
              products and specific user interfaces to your existing systems and services in a
              short amount of time.
